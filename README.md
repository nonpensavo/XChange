Company name is not listed for privacy reasons and to hide this project even better from curious eyes

## Features
- Functionality requirements met
- Simple localization examples (app UI doesnt have much text to work with). 
- Uses Realm object oriented local persistence storage
- UI, quick and responsive. Its not **super** pretty, but not ugly either (humble). Most potential UX issues are addressed
- Dark mode support ^^ (Who doesnt like dark mode?)
- Used Libraries list with licenses is in Settings (iOS)
- Unit tests for public methods and features

## Technical specifications
Used tech for development
- [Swift] - app programming language
- [Xcode] - Version 12.4 (12D4e)
- [CocoaPods] - in order to use handy libraries
- [RealmSwift] - local object oriented persistence storage
- [RxSwift] - reactive extensions for Swift

Also there is a possibility to use RxCocoa for demonstrative functions, if needed.

## Installation and launch

Clone / Download & Unpack and run the project via `XChange.xcworkspace` file, as we use cocoapods.
You may need to set development team settings and address other Xcode complains at first start.
You can run project in iPhone, iPad simulators or devices with iOS 13 or higher.

Had to gitignore Pods directory due to large file issue with Realm pod: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/7157
Close Xcode, and from terminal:
```
cd "project path"
pod install
```
If other issues, please contact me any time, I will fix it right away or send project in other ways.

As optional convenience, I uploaded project folder to [Google Drive file] with link access.
